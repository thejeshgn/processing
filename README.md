From my class @ National Institute of Design (NID), Bangalore.

My class room examples and source of the slides. BTW slides are [online](http://thejeshgn.com/presentations/processing101/).

Processing is an open source programming language and integrated development environment for artists. Its used by artists to build art, visualizations and simulations. This course serves as introductory course to programming in processing.
